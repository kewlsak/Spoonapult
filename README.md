# Spoonapult
Python program that controls a Catapult powered by a Raspberry Pi with an attached Adafruit servo hat. Servos attached to the hat control tension, angle, yaw (rotation) and the catapult arm locking mechanism.

The name 'Spoonapult' comes from my first implementation which uses a wooden spoon as the catapult's launching arm.

# Dependancies

The Adafruit_PWM_Servo_Driver is used by the Servo.py code to control the servo hat. The code for this can be git from:

git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Raspberry-Pi-Python-Code.git
